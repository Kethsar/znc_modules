# ZNC Modules
Python modules for ZNC, an IRC bouncer.

## Hanyuu Proxy
A command proxy for Hanyuu, a bot in #r/a/dio@irc.rizon.net

Allows white-listed users to PM commands to someone running this script in order to use commands for the bot that would otherwise require half-op or higher channel access.

## Hanyuu Guestauth
Allows temporary authorization to use commands with Hanyuu. This makes it easier for guest DJs to stream without someone with channel access doing all the necessary commands for them.
