# ZNC Modules
Python modules for ZNC, an IRC bouncer.

## Hanyuu Proxy
A command proxy for Hanyuu, a bot in #r/a/dio@irc.rizon.net

Allows white-listed users to PM commands to someone running this script in order to use commands for the bot that would otherwise require half-op or higher channel access. Only useful for r/a/dio.

## Hanyuu Guestauth
Allows temporary authorization to use commands with Hanyuu. This makes it easier for guest DJs to stream without someone with channel access doing all the necessary commands for them. Only useful for r/a/dio.

## emojiban
Script to automatically set a temporary ban on users that post emojis. Also auto-kicks on most emoticons. Made to prevent people from trying to time their use of emoji/emoticons for when someone with channel access is not around to hand out punishment. Meant for channels that want to actually enforce a no emoji/emoticon rule.
